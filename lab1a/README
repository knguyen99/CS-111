simpsh.c: 
	This is a c program that acts as a stripped down, simple shell. It does not
	use scripting language nor interact with it at terminal. In this first part
	only --rdonly --wronly --verbose and --command options have been implemented.

Makefile:
	The makefile supports the following targets: 
	default:
		Compiles and builds the program to use.
	clean: 
		Removes the program and all temporary files created from the default.
	dist:
		Creates the tarball for submission
	test:
		Three different tests I have created to ensure correction
		
		test 1: this test that the files I created were able to be accessed with
		the right flags. My program exited with 0, which it should have.
		
		test 2: this test that the files I created were able to be accessed 
		correctly, and that --command could be used correctly with the cat command.
		
		test 3: this test made sure that the right statement was printed when the
		verbose option was enabled.
