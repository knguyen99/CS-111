	builds and runs on an embedded system. This program samples
	a temperature sensor at a configurable rate, converts the 
	temperatures with to a specific option, creates a report 
	of the temperatures, and appends report to a logfile. The 
	application also logs button state and shuts down when 
	button is pressed.

	Makefile: A Makefile that suppports the following targts:
		default: compiles and builds program executable

		check: execute an automated smoke-test of your 
		application to see if it runs and can talk to 
		its sensors.

		clean: delete all programs and output generated 
		by the Makefile. 

		dist: create the deliverable tarball.
